Hello, My name is Francisco Peralta and I'm a Front-end developer.
I have over 7 years of experience and along this years I have been the opportunity to work for all kind of clients, from an Startup technology agency to Google in the gTech team.
One of my biggest passions are to coding, be a developer is a lifestyle, you always looking for the new technologies and the best practices, I compare this to life, you always need to be looking for the best version of yourself.
